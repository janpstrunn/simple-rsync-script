### Simple rsync script

Don't expect it to be nothing, but simple.

## rsync-delete

Allows you to create a identical replica of the directory source, deleting everything in a folder that isn't in the source and updating all the older files

## rsync-update

Allows you to only update all the files, adding the ones that are missing and updating the oens that are old
